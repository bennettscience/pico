Pico is mean to be ultra-lightweight. Coming in around 10KB <i>total</i>, it's bare bones writing and publishing.

Once it's running, you can add text files to a directory and the browser does the rest. Text is wrapped in <code>p</code> tags and displayed in a clean, easy to read window. No logins, no database, and no online editor. Write anywhere and publish anywhere.

Files have two lines of metadata: a title and a publishing date (for indexing). If you don't care about the publish date, you can omit it and posts will be displayed alphabetically.

Since each file is plaintext that renders to HTML, you can still reference images as long as you can get a URI for that image.

Images are automatically resized to fit inside the viewport so you shouldn't have any bleeding off the edge of the screen.
