title: RSS Alpha

RSS is essential. This site now has an alpha-version of an RSS feed generated by an open-source Python script called <b>genRSS</b>.

The script watches your files directory and updates an RSS 2.0 formatted feed when new files are added. Some other changes were made to make the feed easier to generate:

1. Remapped the '/posts/<slug>' URL pattern to 'files/<slug>' for simplification.
2. The feed shows the first line of each post as a snippet
3. The feed is sorted based on document creation (when it was put on the server) so you don't need to worry about timestamp string format.

Because it's run from a python script, it's using cron to periodically update the feed. At this point, I'm not sure's a way to create the feed without cron.
